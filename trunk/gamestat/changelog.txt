Fixes:
* Admin: Forgot to add the external definition for the admin index menu.  Sorry.

* Templates / BF2142: Fixed a condition where teams were only shown if a team array did not exist.
* Templates / UT3: Only show player and team arrays if there is player info available.

==[ version 0.06 ]====[ 2008.09.04 ]==

Adds:
* Templates / BF2142: Add support for Battlefield 2142!
* Admin: Support under EXM menu structure in XOOPS 2.3/ImpressCMS.

Changes:
* Module: Renamed directory to uhq_gamestat, for better coding practice.  This should not change again.
* Module: Updated logo to XOOPS 2.3 standards.  Now features a controller instead of the UT logo.
* Module: Did a couple of code cleanup items to eliminate some errors.

==[ Version 0.05 ]====[ 2008.08.08 ]==

Adds:
* Templates / UT3: Add support for Unreal Tournament 3!
  Please note that server versions less than 3590 will not report player or team statistics.

Changes:
* Blocks: Fixed a bug where one player would display as plural.
* Blocks: Grab the actual player count if the query provides it, and count the player array only if this variable is absent.
* Blocks / Status: Updates to populate block from differing source info.

* Templates / UT: More fields are supported.  I don't quite know how I want to display the team variables, however.
* Templates / Generic: Fleshed out a few more general options more for unsupported game types.

* Updated module logo to use the 9pt Bit3 font.  It's not a 10-point as I had originally thought.

Notes:
* Version 0.04 was actually released on 2008-08-06.  Updated the changelog to reflect that.

* This is not a typical release cycle.  I must be on some kind of coding crack at the moment.


==[ Version 0.04 ]====[ 2008.08.06 ]==

Adds:
* Blocks / SrvInfo: A largely game-agnostic block which relies on templates to process the output for any given type of game.
* hasMain set to 1.  Updated root index.php accordingly.  We need a place to put the verbose info block.  There is no place better than the GameStat main page!  However, there are no real functions in this block at this time.

Games:
* More complete support for Unreal Tournament.

Changes:
* Fix so that general module configuration can actually be changed.
* Restored a few skeletal files for future use.
* Image references are absolute to the web root, and not relative.
* Changed text in block templates to smarty, referencing the language definitions.

Notes:
* While GameQ can poll a large number of games, the output for certain fields is likely to vary depending on the engine.  Templates for individual games will be constructed on a requested basis.

==[ version 0.03 ]====[ 2008.08.01 ]==

Adds:
* Blocks / Status: Added gametype, ipfqdn, port # to the block configuration.

Changes:
* General Configuration: Removed gametype, ipfqdn, port #.
* Blocks / Status: Fixed a couple typos.
* Blocks / Status: Show no additional details if the server is offline.

==[ version 0.02 ]====[ 2008.04.05 ]==

Adds:
* Using GameQ Version 1.0 (2008-04-01) by Tom Buskens
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gameq/
* Simple online/offline status block w/ a player count if available.
* Online/Offline images for server status (I was bored).
* General Configuration: Added querytimeout, for all queries.

Changes:
* Spell out the port to use should be the query port, not the game port.

==[ version 0.01 ]====[ 2008.03.29 ]==

Adds:
* Skeletal frame w/ logo.
* General Configuration: gametype, serveripfqdn, serverport

Notes:
